Examples
Single Responsibility Principle	
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/formatters/date-time-formatter.ts
    line 18-33, 
    class DateTimeFormatter is responsible for presenting date time string. 
    
Open / Closed Principle	
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/formatters/price-formatter.ts
    line 35
    PricedFormatter is closed for modification, but open for extension. (class PercentageFormatter - extends base PriceFormatter class to reimplement format() method)
    
Liskov Substitution Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/formatters/percentage-formatter.ts
    line 3-11
    class PercentageFormatter - PriceFormatter can be swapped with PercentageFormatter. 

Interface Segregation Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/views/pane/iupdatable-pane-view.ts
    line: 5-7, 
    interface IUpdatablePaneView extends IPaneView and adds update method. 

Dependency Inversion Principle	
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/gui/mouse-event-handler.ts
    line: 158-162, 
    class MouseEventHandler depends on abstractions MouseEventHandlers, MouseEventHandlerOptions


Violaitions:
Single Responsibility Principle	
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/model/chart-model.ts
    line: 337-932, 
    too many methods

Open / Closed Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/model/pane.ts
    line: 81-94
    switch statement will need to be modified if other variants are to be added.

Liskov Substitution Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/api/candlestick-series-api.ts
    line: 8-13
    class CandlestickSeriesApi takes more specific arguments in applyOptions

Interface Segregation Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/gui/mouse-event-handler.ts
    line: 13-41
    MouseEventHandlers could be split into two or more interfaces 

Dependency Inversion Principle
    https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/src/formatters/date-time-formatter.ts 
    line: 18-33
    class DateTimeFormatter depends on DateFormatter and TimeFormatter instead of an interface.
